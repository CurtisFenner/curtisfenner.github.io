# Big Heading

This section is very important.
This section is very important.
This section is very important. And long.
This section is very important.
This section is very important.
This section is very important.
This section is very important.
This section is very important.

```typescript
type foo: Foo = {
  field1: string,
  field2: `alpha{$number}beta`,
};

function f(x: (f: Foo) => Foo, y: Foo, z: Foo): Foo {
    return y.field1 < z.field1
        ? x(y)
        : x(z);
}
```

That's because, as Mark Twain once said,

The following sections will go into more detail.

## Subheading Section of Many Words

This section will include a multi-level list, because I like lists more than I
like long sections of prose. I find they make it easier to follow arguments
clearly and such.

* This is the first item.
* This is the second item.
    * The second item requires additional detail, so here's a sub-bullet.
    * And another one.
        * Recursion allows us to add as many layers as we would like.
        * Alpha $\beta + \gamma + \delta$
    * Although the whitespace method that markdown uses means that Markdown
      is not a context-free language.
      > This is justified by a quote from some authorative source.
      >
      > \- George Washington
    * Not that that matters. I've tried to look at Markdown and I'm not
      going to attempt to write a Markdown parser.
* This is the third and final item. It's a long paragraph, which will flow onto
  multiple lines, which is also an important thing to be able to test, even at,
  or even, especially, at, the top level.

This is a really ridiculously and quite frankly totally untentable length for
a heading and I'm embarrassed I chose to include it in this article.

Oh well.
