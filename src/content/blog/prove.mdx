I worked with Dr. Martin Strauss, Elizabeth Viera, and Dr. Gavin La
Rose to build a library to integrate tabular-proof problems into the
WeBWorK open-source online math homework platform used by University
of Michigan.

A two-column proof is entered as a number of input fields.

The first column is a sequence of logical statements.

The subsequent columns are the <em>justifications</em> of those statements, including
"citing" previously justfied statements within the proof. Read on for more detail about
the structure of these justifications.

## Proof Structure

In this project, a proof is a sequence of statements that have
			justifications.
A <em>statement</em> is some (boolean) expression asserting some
			fact. Examples of statements include

* &forall;x P(x)
* x = f(y)
* P(a, b) &and; P(b, a)

A <em>justification</em> is the reason it is valid to write a
particular statement. Examples include

* <em>given</em>: the statement is given as true as part of the
	exercise.
* <em>reflexivity of '='</em>: the statement follows from some
	basic, universal property
* <em>modus ponens</em>: the statement follows from a basic
	deduction rule, such as modus ponens
* <em>subproof</em>: the statement does not necessarily follow
	from previous statements, <em>but</em> it is a valid starting
	point to prove some lemma. For example, a contradiction subproof
	begins by supposing something that is thought to be false.

	It ends by concluding the complement of what was supposed, once
	a contradiction has been reached.

	See a full description in the <em>Subproofs</em> section.

## Proof Verification

A proof is verified by validating a number of things.

* The statements are well-formed and do not violate any of the
	rules of any of the operations used
* The justifications refer only to in-scope statements.
	To be in-scope, a statement must appear before the current
	statement, and not be in a closed subproof.
* The proof has closed all subproofs.
* The justification of every statement is correct. (This depends
	on the rule being used; see the next section for an in-depth
	example)
* The thing that was supposed to be proved was proved

Because these checks are all done separately, it's possible to
give detailed responses to partially correct / partially complete proofs.

## Subproofs
This project uses a system called <em>Natural Deduction</em>. Proofs
			are
			sequences of <em>statements</em> and <em>subproofs</em>. Statements
			are justified given previous in-scope statements.

<em>Subproofs</em> are sequences of statements that begin by
			supposing some statement is true. Depending on the kind of subproof,
			different statements may be supposed.

Statements inside a sub-proof are <em>scoped</em> to that subproof
			(in a way similar to lexical scoping in programming language).
			The statement is no longer in-scope after the subproof ends, and
			cannot be referenced by any further justifications.

When a subproof ends, it concludes with a single statement that is
			in-scope
			for the remainder of the proof. The <em>conclusion</em> that is
			allowed depends on the type of subproof that was opened.

For example, this is what a <b>Contradiction subproof</b> looks like.

| #                          | Statement                   | Justification                                                                                       |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="box">1</span> | &forall;x, P(x) &rArr; Q(x) | Given                                                                                               |
| <span class="box">2</span> | &not;Q(5)                   | Given                                                                                               |
| <span class="box">3</span> | &hellip;&hellip; P(5)       | Suppose for Contradiction Subproof                                                                  |
| <span class="box">4</span> | &hellip;&hellip; Q(5)       | Modus Ponens on <span class="box">1</span> and <span class="box">3</span>                           |
| <span class="box">5</span> | &not;P(5)                   | Conclusion of Contradiction Subproof from <span class="box">2</span> and <span class="box">4</span> |

Notice that statement <span class="box">3</span> does <em>not</em>
follow from the previous statements. The subproof simply supposes
that it is true to derive a contradiction.

Because the subproof concludes in <span class="box">5</span>, statement
<span class="box">6</span> may <em>not</em> reference statements
<span class="box">3</span> or <span class="box">4</span>.

Notice that statement <span class="box">4</span> <em>does</em> depend
on statement <span class="box">3</span>, because it is in the body of
the subproof. This is what allows a contradiction to be reached.

The <em>conclusion</em> of the subproof is based on in-scope
statements, <em>combined</em> with the statement that was used to
introduce the subproof. The statements explicitly listed in the
justification are verified to be a contradiction; this fact is used
with <span class="box">3</span> to produce the conclusion in
<span class="box">6</span>.

## Verification Example 1 &ndash; Universal Elimination

Justifications are mostly verified by matching the student's
statement and the previous statements against different statement
structures.

Consider this simple proof involving Universal Elimination.

> Prove that Q(cos(5)+1) is true given that &forall;x, Q(x+1) is true.

| #                          | Statement                   | Justification                                       |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="box">1</span> | &forall;x, Q(x + 1)         | Given                                               |
| <span class="box">2</span> | Q(cos(5) + 1)               | Universal Elimination of <span class="box">1</span> |

The justification "Universal Elimination of
<span class="box">1</span> results <span class="box">2</span>"
needs to be checked.

First, the statements are parsed and turned into trees of operations.
(Note that here, there is an explicit function/predicate application
operator <em>$</em>)

		<figure class="inline">
			<figcaption>Statement <span class="box">1</span></figcaption>
			<ol class="tree">
				<li>&forall;</li>
				<ol>
					<li>x</li>
					<li>$</li>
					<ol>
						<li>Q</li>
						<li>+</li>
						<ol>
							<li>x</li>
							<li>1</li>
						</ol>
					</ol>
				</ol>
			</ol>
		</figure>
		<figure class="inline">
			<figcaption>Statement <span class="box">2</span></figcaption>
			<ol class="tree">
				<li>$</li>
				<ol>
					<li>Q</li>
					<li>+</li>
					<ol>
						<li>$</li>
						<ol>
							<li>cos</li>
							<li>5</li>
						</ol>
						<li>1</li>
					</ol>
				</ol>
			</ol>
		</figure>

The checker for Universal Elimination begins by matching Statement
<span class="box">1</span> against a small tree to
verify that it is a for-all statement.

		<ol class="tree">
			<li>&forall;</li>
			<ol>
				<li><span class="bubble">variable</span></li>
				<li><span class="bubble">predicate</span></li>
			</ol>
		</ol>

When this match succeeds, we get the assignments

		<ul>
			<li><span class="bubble">variable</span> is x</li>
			<li><span class="bubble">predicate</span> is Q(x + 1)</li>
		</ul>

Next, we want to make a pattern from this to check the student's
			input in Statement <span class="box">2</span>. To do this, all
			instances of <span class="bubble">variable</span> (in this case, just
			<em>x</em>) are substituted with a pattern-matching-variable
			<span class="bubble">instance</span> inside the
			<span class="bubble">predicate</span> tree.

This yields the pattern

		<ol class="tree">
			<li>$</li>
			<ol>
				<li>Q</li>
				<li>+</li>
				<ol>
					<li><span class="bubble">instance</span></li>
					<li>1</li>
				</ol>
			</ol>
		</ol>

The students answer <span class="box">2</span> is matched against this
			pattern, yielding the assignment

		<ul>
			<li><span class="bubble">instance</span> is cos(5)</li>
		</ul>

Thus, the justification was valid and the statement is justified.

## Verification Example 2 &ndash; Universal Elimination

Consider the following <strong>incorrect</strong> proof.

| #                          | Statement              | Justification                                       |
|----------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="box">1</span> | &forall;x, R(x+1, x+1) | Given                                               |
| <span class="box">2</span> | R(6+1, 5+1)            | Universal Elimination of <span class="box">1</span> |

As in Example 1, first Statement <span class="box">1</span> is verified
to be a for-all statement. The following pattern is constructed to
be used to match valid instantiations of it (by substituting all
appearances of <span class="bubble">variable</span> with a
pattern-matching variable <span class="bubble">instance</span>).

		<ol class="tree">
			<li>$</li>
			<ol>
				<li>R</li>
				<li>+</li>
				<ol>
					<li><span class="bubble">instance</span></li>
					<li>1</li>
				</ol>
				<li>+</li>
				<ol>
					<li><span class="bubble">instance</span></li>
					<li>1</li>
				</ol>
			</ol>
		</ol>

This is matched against Statement <span class="box">2</span>.

It establishes the following assignments:
		<ol>
			<li><span class="bubble">instance</span> is 6</li>
			<li><span class="bubble">instance</span> is 5</li>
		</ol>

Note that the same pattern-matching variable is assigned a value
			<em>twice</em>. Since 5 &ne; 6, the match fails, and the proof
			checker reports
			"Not a valid instantiation of &forall;x, R(x+1, x+1)"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Consider a similar, <strong>correct</strong> proof:

| #                          | Statement          | Justification                                       |
|----------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="box">1</span> | &forall;x, R(x, x) | Given                                               |
| <span class="box">2</span> | R(2+3, 3+2)        | Universal Elimination of <span class="box">1</span> |

This time, the following assignments occur:

<ol>
	<li><span class="bubble">instance</span> is 2+3</li>
	<li><span class="bubble">instance</span> is 3+2</li>
</ol>

Here, when the second assignment is found, it is compared against the
first one. This comparison can be "smart" and know about the
commutativity of '+', and thus allow the assignment.

If an instructor wants to disallow these kinds of 'skipping steps',
the comparison can be left "dumb" and reject the different form.

## Verification Example 3 &ndash; Existential Elimination

Here is an example proof that uses the Existential Elimination
subproof.

| #                          | Statement                        | Justification |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------|
| <span class="box">1</span> | &forall;x, P(x) &rArr; Q(x)      | Given
| <span class="box">2</span> | &exist;y, P(y)                   | Given
| <span class="box">3</span> | &hellip;&hellip;P(c)             | Suppose (for an object called c) from Existential Elimination on <span class="box">2</span>
| <span class="box">4</span> | &hellip;&hellip;P(c) &rArr; Q(c) | Universal Elimination of <span class="box">1</span>
| <span class="box">5</span> | &hellip;&hellip;Q(c)             | Modus Ponens on <span class="box">3</span> and <span class="box">4</span>
| <span class="box">6</span> | &hellip;&hellip;&exist;y, Q(y)   | Existential Introduction from <span class="box">5</span>
| <span class="box">7</span> | &exist;y, Q(y)                   | Conclusion of Existential Elimination subproof from <span class="box">6</span>

Note that the kind of statement that can be supposed in a Existential
Elimination subproof is fairly limited; the name of a constant is
simply given to a there-exists statement.

The conclusion can be any statement that does <em>not</em> involve
the name introduced at the beginning.
