    A short summary of the 'Jobs-to-be-Done' innovation framework,
    from my perspective
published: "2025-04-06 draft"
---

[_Jobs to be Done_](https://jobs-to-be-done-book.com/) is a methodology for
approaching **innovation** in any enterprise.

The authors, through their experience consulting with many small and large
businesses, and through their poring over of research into business practices,
have concluded that Jobs-to-be-Done is ***the only framework for innovating that
reliably achieves results***.

My experience as a software engineer has generally supported this position; the
most successful products and launches are the ones that have aligned with the\
way Jobs-to-be-Done recommends doing things.

The _Jobs to be Done_ book is available for free as an e-book, and is a fairly
quick and easy read, but I find most of the detail in it is not very relevant or
interesting to an individual-contributor. A lot of the book focuses on building
the exacting processes to ensure Jobs-to-be-Done is being followed "correctly"

# Summary

## "Ideas First" vs "Needs First"

The authors summarize two main approaches to innovating that are followed at
most companies.

* "Ideas first":
    * Companies **brainstorm** product or service ideas, then test them with
      customers to see how well they fit customer needs
    * This approach is **inherently flawed**, yet **extremely popular**.
        * > If you want to succeed, double your failure rate.
          >
          > - IBM founder Thomas Watson
    * **Customers cannot articulate the sollutions that they want.**
        * > "Why are we even asking customers what solutions they want?"
        * It's OUR job as designers and engineers to solve problems!
* "Needs first":
    * Companies study their customers to learn **what their needs are**,
    * then find out **which of their customers' needs are unmet**.
    * Most companies which _try_ to follow a "needs first" approach execute the
      approach poorly.

Jobs-to-be-Done advocates a particular way to successfully implement the
"Needs first" approach for innovation.

## Jobs to be Done

The "Jobs to be Done" framework is all about building a way to
**talk about customer needs** so that we can efficiently find and meet them

> **"People don't want to buy a quarter-inch drill.
> They want a quarter-inch hole!"**

> - Levitt

The authors experience has suggested

* customers are loyal to **the jobs that they need done**, **not** to their
  (current) solutions to those jobs
* customers are willing to change solutions (**only**) if the new solution
  **solves the job 20% better**

### The Language of Jobs to be Done

A **job** is a task that a customer needs to perform.

An **outcome** is a measure that a customer (usually, implicitly) uses to
determine if the job was done well.

### Articulating Needs as "Jobs"

Customers have **dozens to hundreds of separate needs**. It is therefore
important to **carefully articulate each important need** and avoid clumping too
many together.

No single solution can address every one of a customer's needs.

Even for a single job and a single solution, some customers (or segments of
customers) may consider the solution to solve the job well, and some not.

* It's therefore important to segment customers **by their needs** rather than
  by demographics, economics, etc.

#### Don't confuse jobs and solutions.

Jobs should be stable over time. "Enjoy listening to music" is a job;
solutions (vinyl records, CDs, MP3 players, streaming) change over time.

Jobs are generally indifferent to the way that they're solved. A single job
could be solved either on paper or on a computer; in person or virtually; etc.

#### Don't forget about "emotional" and "social" outcomes

How people want to feel (or avoid feeling!) when doing tasks is also important.

#### Avoid conflating outcomes and jobs

#### Avoid conflating situations and jobs

A _situation_ such as "being bored" isn't a job.

"Overcoming boredom" is closer, but is too general to be analyzed. Pick a more
specific job, such as "enjoy a beverage during a commute".

#### A suggested format

> (verb) (object) + (context)

For example, "Listen to music while on the go."

The "context" should clarify what kind of customer has the job, and therefore
what outcomes and sub-needs may be important. A commuter vs a student vs a WFH
employee may have very different priorities when trying to solve the above job.

### Figure out what your customer's outcome metrics are

Your customers may want to get the job done

* quicker
* cheaper
* with less waste
* more predictably
* ...

They probably care about multiple of these dimensions, but they probably care
about some more than others.

If you find out which are most important, you can make sure that you're
innovating in a way that will actually make your solution meet their needs
better.

_Remember that you need to be at least 20% better than the alternative to
convince a customer to switch to your solution!_

# Strategy

In business, one of the fundamental goals is to _make money_. Similarly, a
fundamental outcome customers have is _how cheap the solution was_.

A solution will win when it gets a job done _better_ (quicker, more reliably,
more efficiently, ...), but _better_ is often at odds with _cheaper_.

This suggests four main "quadrants" of business opportunity that should be
tackled differently:

|                                       |  _More expensive_ than<br />other solutions     | | _Cheaper_ than<br />other solutions    |
|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-|----------------------------------------|
| **_Worse_ than<br />other solutions** | Capture customers with _completely unmet needs_ | | Capture customers who are _overserved_ |
|                                       |                                                 | |                                        |
| **_Better_ than<br />other solutions**| Capture customers with _under-met needs_        | | ***The ideal!***                       |

An **overserved** customer has solutions to needs that they don't value (for
example, lots of shiny features that they don't actually care about)

* To capture these customers, target _cost reduction_: do the same job, but
  cheaper.

An **underserved** customer has a solution that meets some of their needs, but
not others.
* To capture these customers, target their _most important needs_ or build
  solutions that _improve their most important outcomes_.

## Value Proposition

To convince a customer to buy your solution, you need to convince them that your
solution meets their needs better (at least 20% better!) than the current
solution.

So, market based on the _outcome that is most important to the customer_. The
same solution, marketed based on different _outcomes_, could seem much better or
much worse than alternatives to a customer!

Sometimes, customers have unmet needs that could be met by a _product or service
you already have on sale!_ But if you don't market the product around meeting
that need (or improving the most important outcome), customers won't know they
can have that need met!

# Outcome Driven Innovation: Executing Jobs-to-be-Done

**Outcome Driven Innovation** (ODI) is the name of the process to follow that
executes on the theory presented by "Jobs to be Done".

ODI defines the **customer** as the person who **executes the job**.

They are **not** the person who **purchases the solution**. They are the person
who **sees the outcome of the job**, and so they **are the best person to ask
about what outcomes are important**.

The **purchase decision maker** is more interested in **financial outcomes**
(such as how much the solution costs), and generally less interested in
functional outcomes (how well the job was done).

## Talking to Customers

Do not ask customers what their jobs-to-be-done are. **They will not tell you**.

Ask them,

* why are you using (current solution)?
* what are you ultimately trying to get done?

Do not take customer's answers at face value.

> Q: "Why did you buy that kettle?"
>
> Customer: "To boil water".
>
> * But "Boiling water" is likely not actually the job the customer needed done!
> * The real job may be **to enjoy tea**.
>     * Solutions like a _hot-beverage vending machine_ do this job,
>       but _they don't do the job of boiling water_.

Think about the important outcome.

> Q: Why is a farmer buying herbicide?
>
> A: To kill weeds? No!
>
> A: To improve crop yields (which would otherwise be reduced by weeds)
