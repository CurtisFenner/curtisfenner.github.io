    A short summary of the 'Jobs-to-be-Done' innovation framework,
    from my perspective

[_Jobs to be Done_](https://jobs-to-be-done-book.com/) is a methodology for
approaching **innovation** that helps you focus on building things your
customers actually want.

I'm usually unimpressed by business jargon, but I think the _Jobs to be Done_
framework is actually a great way to communicate what should be designed and
built, and is an especially good way to keep "business" and "technical" teams on
the same page.

The e-book is free, so you can read the full book at the above link. It's a
fairly fast read, but having recently re-read it, I don't love the book as an
overview of _Jobs to Be Done_ for two main reasons:

* The book is addressed towards business-bureaucrats, who want to build a
  precise management process to improve innovation within their company.

  The authors are business consultants, so they have a lot of experience
  ensuring Jobs-to-be-Done is actually useful to big organizations, and can
  offer a lot of advice to that audience.

  But if you aren't the sort of person in charge of hiring business consultants
  to optimize enterprise synergy, a lot of the book reads as quibbling over
  unimportant details, while I think that imparting the most important ideas
  would be more to most workers who just want to do their work a little better.
* The book is structured more as a story to draw you in, rather than an
  instruction manual or a clear poster outlining the paradigm.

  A lot of the book is dedicated to case-studies where applying Jobs-to-be-Done
  actually revealed new opportunities to a business. This is both interesting
  and informative, but it's also not a convenient way to learn how to get the
  most out of Jobs-to-be-Done.

I want to write this post for regular workers, rather than business
bureaucrats. And I want it to be a quick reference, rather than a detailed,
case-study supported flow chart.

# What is Jobs to be Done?

The authors claim that Jobs-to-be-Done is
***the only framework for innovation that reliably achieves results***.

My experience as a software engineer has generally supported this; the
most successful products and launches are the ones that have aligned with the
way Jobs-to-be-Done recommends doing things.

The "Jobs to be Done" framework is all about building a way to
**talk about what your customers need** so that you can efficiently and
effectively give them what they need.

The overall philosophy is nicely summarized by this quote:

> **"People don't want to buy a quarter-inch drill.**
>
> **They want a quarter-inch hole!"**
>
> - Harvard Business Professor Levitt

## A common vocabulary

One of the main ways Jobs-to-be-Done improves the way teams innovate is by
providing a common, and slightly unusual, vocabulary. The idea is to steer
typical discussions of ideation and customer analysis in the most effective
direction.

Jobs-to-be-Done is *primarily* a shared *vocabulary* of how to talk about your
customers, what they need, and how you solve their problems.

* > A **customer** is someone who needs to get something done.
  > They are the person who gets the work done, **not the person who purchases
  > the solution**. Because the customer sees the outcome of the job,
  > _the customer is the best person to ask about which outcomes are the most
  > important_.
* > A **job** is a task that a customer needs to perform.
  >
  > > Example: The customer has wood planks that will be attached with 0.25"
  > > bolts.
* > A **solution** is a product or service that you sell that can perform a job
  > for your customers.
  > > Example: You sell drills with 0.25" drill bits
* > An **outcome** is a measure that a customer (often, implicitly) uses to
  > determine if the job was done *well*.
  > > Example: The hole is within the required tolerance, and can be drilled
  > > quickly.
  >
  > > Example: It is comfortable and safe to drill holes, and doesn't result in
  > > strain, fatigue, or injuries.
* > When a customer is satisfied by how well a solution works for a job, they
  > **hire** that solution to perform the job.
  > > Example: The customer evaluates the drill, concludes the drill is fast,
  > > sturdy, and precise enough, and so buys one for each of their
  > > assembly-line workers.

Separating the **job** (what the customer needs done) from the **solution**
(how the customer gets it done) is especially important.

* Customers are loyal to **the jobs that they need done**. They are **not** so
  loyal to their (current!) **solution** that they use to complete the job.
* Customers may be willing to change to a new solution, but _only_ if the new
  solution has **outcomes that are 20% better** than the old solution.

In Jobs-to-be-Done, **innovation** is therefore building new **solutions** with
better **outcomes** that **customers** want to **hire** to perform the
**jobs they need done**.

# â€œIdeas First" vs "Needs First"

Jobs to be Done contrasts two basic approaches to innovation:

* "Ideas first": brainstorm **solutions** then test them with different
  customers to see how well they fit customer needs
  * > "If you want to succeed, double your failure rate."
    >
    > - IBM founder Thomas Watson
  * This approach is **inherently flawed** yet **extremely popular** in the
    business world
  * Articulating the Value Proposition of your solution to customers is hard to
    when *you have not analyzed the most important outcomes of their jobs*, so
    even if you have built a good solution, when you show it to customers they
    may not see why it is worth hiring for their jobs!
* **"Needs first"**: study your customers to learn **what jobs they need done**,
  and then find **which of these needs are unmet or under-served**.
  * > **"People don't want to buy a quarter-inch drill.
    > They want a quarter-inch hole!"**
    >
    > - Harvard Business Professor Levitt
  * "Jobs to be Done" has lots of recommendations on how to do this _well_,
    because even most companies which _try_ to follow a "needs first" approach
    execute it poorly

## Articulating customer needs as "Jobs"

Each customer may have **dozens to hundreds of separate needs**. It is therefore
important to carefully catalog and organize them, to avoid clumping too many
needs together. It's also important to keep in mind that no single solution can
address every single one of a customer's needs.

Even for a single job and a single solution, some customers (or segments of
customers) may consider the solution to solve the job well, and some not. It's
therefore important to segment customers **by their needs and desired outcomes**
rather than by demographics, economics, etc.

### Talking to Customers: Solutions vs Jobs

Do not directly ask customers what their needs are. **They will not tell you**.

Ask them,

* why are you using (current solution)?
* what are you ultimately trying to get done?

Do not take customer's answers at face value. It is easy for to confuse a
_solution_ for the _actual job that it is performing_.

For example, imagine asking why an office purchased an electric kettle for their
break room. If you ask directly, the answer will likely be some variation of "to
boil water". But _getting boiled water_ is almost surely _not_ the job that they
need done:

|                           | Boil Water | Enjoy Tea |
|---------------------------| ---------- | --------- |
| Kettle                    | Yes        | Yes       |
| Coffee Maker              | Yes        | Yes       |
| Bunsen burner             | Yes        | NO!       |
| Microwave                 | Yes        | Kinda?    |
| Hot drink vending machine | NO!        | Yes       |

For a _real_ job of "enjoying tea", a bunsen-burner (highly capable of boiling
water) cannot compete; on the other hand, a hot-drink vending machine (incapable
of boiling water) _may_ be able to compete!

This job-based analysis makes this kind of analysis easy, but also sound so
obvious that it sounds like it doesn't need explaining. But a lot of businesses
act in ways that causes them to miss these "obvious" opportunities for
innovation and competition.

### Jobs don't change much over time. Solutions, however, do!

"Enjoy listening to music" has been a stable job throughout human history;
however, the solutions have changed wildly over time. Not so long ago,
portable cassette and CD players were a ubiquitous multi-billion-dollar market;
now, they are nearly irrelevant because of phone/laptop music libraries and
streaming.

Any particular job could be solved by radically different means. You are
competing with companies who have products and services that sound nothing like
yours!

## Think about the important outcome

The immediate impact of a solution may not be the most important outcome.

For example, consider a corn farmer buying herbicide. Are they buying the
herbicide to kill weeds? Yes, but _that is not the important outcome_:

> Less weeds means _more healthy corn_, which is the important outcome.
>
> But there are _many_ ways to increase corn yield. For example, recently it has
been found that installing solar panels above crops can actually increase their
yields!
>
> This outcome-centric approach makes it clear that a *solar panel company*
> can actually be in direct competition with a *weed-be-gone spray company*!

This kind of business strategy is very hard to notice without following through
to what your customers are ultimately trying to get done!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Figure out what your customer's outcome metrics are

Your customers may want to get the job done

* quicker
* cheaper
* with less waste
* more predictably
* ...

They probably care about multiple of these dimensions, but they probably care
about some more than others.

If you find out which are most important, you can make sure that you're
innovating in a way that will actually make your solution meet their needs
better.

_Remember that you need to be at least 20% better than the alternative to
convince a customer to switch to your solution!_

# Strategy

The Jobs-to-be-Done authors posit that customers are more loyal to **jobs** than
they are **solutions**. They estimate that **if the most important outcomes are
20% better with a new solution, customers will be willing to hire that new
solution**.

It's therefore _critical_ that before building a new solution, you must
determine the most important outcomes, and ensure that they are **20% better
than the competition**.

## Under- and Over-served Needs

In business, one of the fundamental goals is to _make money_. Similarly, a
fundamental outcome customers have is _how cheap the solution was_.

A solution will win when it gets a job done _better_ (quicker, more reliably,
more efficiently, ...), but _better_ is often at odds with _cheaper_.

This suggests four main "quadrants" of business opportunity that should be
tackled differently:

|                                       |  _More expensive_ than<br />other solutions     | _Cheaper_ than<br />other solutions    |
|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **_Worse_ than<br />other solutions** | Capture customers with _completely unmet needs_ | Capture customers who are _overserved_ |
| **_Better_ than<br />other solutions**| Capture customers with _under-met needs_        | ***The ideal!***                       |

An **overserved** customer has solutions to needs that they don't value (for
example, lots of shiny features that they don't actually care about)

* To capture these customers, target _cost reduction_: do the same job, but
  cheaper.

An **underserved** customer has a solution that meets some of their needs, but
not others.
* To capture these customers, target their _most important needs_ or build
  solutions that _improve their most important outcomes_.

## Value Proposition

To convince a customer to buy your solution, you need to convince them that your
solution meets their needs better (at least 20% better!) than the current
solution.

So, market based on the _outcome that is most important to the customer_. The
same solution, marketed based on different _outcomes_, could seem much better or
much worse than alternatives to a customer!

Sometimes, customers have unmet needs that could be met by a _product or service
you already have on sale!_ But if you don't market the product around meeting
that need (or improving the most important outcome), customers won't know they
can have that need met!

## Purchaser vs Customer

Jobs-to-be-Done defines the **customer** as the person who **executes the job**.

They are **not** the person who **purchases the solution**. They are the person
who **sees the outcome of the job**, and so they **are the best person to ask
about what outcomes are important**.

The **purchase decision maker** is more interested in **financial outcomes**
(such as how much the solution costs), and generally less interested in
functional outcomes (how well the job was done).
