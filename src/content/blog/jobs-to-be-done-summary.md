    A short summary of the 'Jobs-to-be-Done' innovation framework,
    from my perspective
published: "2025-04-14 draft"
---

[_Jobs to be Done_](https://jobs-to-be-done-book.com/) is a methodology for
approaching **innovation** that helps you focus on building things your
customers actually want.

I'm usually unimpressed by business jargon, but I think the _Jobs to be Done_
framework is actually a great way to communicate what should be designed and
built, and is an especially good way to keep "business" and "technical" teams on
the same page.

The e-book is free, so you can read the full book at the above link. It's a
fairly fast read, but having recently re-read it, I don't love the book as an
overview of _Jobs to Be Done_ for two main reasons:

* The book is addressed towards business-bureaucrats, who want to build a
  precise management process to improve innovation within their company.

  The authors are business consultants, so they have a lot of experience
  ensuring Jobs-to-be-Done is actually useful to big organizations, and can
  offer a lot of advice to that audience.

  But if you aren't the sort of person in charge of hiring business consultants
  to optimize enterprise synergy, a lot of the book reads as quibbling over
  unimportant details, while I think that imparting the most important ideas
  would be more to most workers who just want to do their work a little better.
* The book is structured more as a story to draw you in, rather than an
  instruction manual or a clear poster outlining the paradigm.

  A lot of the book is dedicated to case-studies where applying Jobs-to-be-Done
  actually revealed new opportunities to a business. This is both interesting
  and informative, but it's also not a convenient way to learn how to get the
  most out of Jobs-to-be-Done.

I want to write this post for regular workers, rather than business
bureaucrats. And I want it to be a quick reference, rather than a detailed,
case-study supported flow chart.

# What is Jobs to be Done?

The authors claim that Jobs-to-be-Done is
***the only framework for innovation that reliably achieves results***.

My experience as a software engineer has generally supported this; the
most successful products and launches are the ones that have aligned with the
way Jobs-to-be-Done recommends doing things.

The "Jobs to be Done" framework is all about building a way to
**talk about what your customers need** so that you can efficiently and
effectively give them what they need.

The overall philosophy is nicely summarized by this quote:

> **"People don't want to buy a quarter-inch drill.**
>
> **They want a quarter-inch hole!"**
>
> - Harvard Business Professor Levitt

## A common vocabulary

One of the main ways Jobs-to-be-Done improves the way teams innovate is by
providing a common, and slightly unusual, vocabulary. The idea is to steer
typical discussions of ideation and customer analysis in the most effective
direction.

Jobs-to-be-Done is *primarily* a shared *vocabulary* of how to talk about your
customers, what they need, and how you solve their problems.

* > A **customer** is someone who needs to get something done.
  > They are the person who gets the work done, **not the person who purchases
  > the solution**. Because the customer sees the outcome of the job,
  > _the customer is the best person to ask about which outcomes are the most
  > important_.
* > A **job** is a task that a customer needs to perform.
  >
  > > Example: The customer has wood planks that will be attached with 0.25"
  > > bolts.
* > A **solution** is a product or service that you sell that can perform a job
  > for your customers.
  > > Example: You sell drills with 0.25" drill bits
* > An **outcome** is a measure that a customer (often, implicitly) uses to
  > determine if the job was done *well*.
  > > Example: The hole is within the required tolerance, and can be drilled
  > > quickly.
  >
  > > Example: It is comfortable and safe to drill holes, and doesn't result in
  > > strain, fatigue, or injuries.
* > When a customer is satisfied by how well a solution works for a job, they
  > **hire** that solution to perform the job.
  > > Example: The customer evaluates the drill, concludes the drill is fast,
  > > sturdy, and precise enough, and so buys one for each of their
  > > assembly-line workers.

Separating the **job** (what the customer needs done) from the **solution**
(how the customer gets it done) is especially important.

* Customers are loyal to **the jobs that they need done**. They are **not** so
  loyal to their (current!) **solution** that they use to complete the job.
* Customers may be willing to change to a new solution, but _only_ if the new
  solution has **outcomes that are 20% better** than the old solution.

----

In Jobs-to-be-Done, **Innovation** is therefore building new **solutions** with
better **outcomes** that **customers** want to **hire** to perform the
**jobs they need done**.

## Articulating customer needs as "Jobs"

Each customer may have **dozens to hundreds of separate needs**. It is therefore
important to carefully catalog and organize them, to avoid clumping too many
needs together. It's also important to keep in mind that no single solution can
address every single one of a customer's needs.

### Don't confuse jobs and solutions.

For example, when I'm starting work, I often get a take-out latte. This
fulfills two of my needs:

* I want caffeine in the morning so that I can stay focused and productive
* I like having something to sip or nibble on when I'm settling into my desk to
  help me relax and get into the right headspace

But, a hot coffee isn't the only solution that meets these needs!
* An espresso float
* A granola bar and a vending machine green-tea
* A cola slushy

### Jobs don't change much over time. Solutions, however, do!

"Enjoy listening to music" has been a stable job throughout human history;
however, the solutions have changed wildly over time. Not so long ago,
portable cassette and CD players were a ubiquitous multi-billion-dollar market;
now, they are nearly irrelevant because of phone/laptop music libraries and
streaming.

Any particular job could be solved by radically different means. You are
competing with companies who have products and services that sound nothing like
yours!

# Talking to Customers

Do not ask customers what their needs are. **They will not tell you**.

Ask them,

* why are you using (current solution)?
* what are you ultimately trying to get done?

Do not take customer's answers at face value.

> Q: "Why did you buy that kettle?"
>
> Customer: "To boil water".
>
> * But "Boiling water" is likely not actually the job the customer needed done!
> * The real job may be **to enjoy tea**.
>     * Solutions like a _hot-beverage vending machine_ do this job,
>       but _they don't do the job of boiling water_.

Think about the important outcome.

> Q: Why is a farmer buying herbicide?
>
> A: To kill weeds? No!
>
> A: To improve crop yields (which would otherwise be reduced by weeds)

## â€œIdeas First" vs "Needs First"

The authors summarize two main approaches to innovating that are followed at
most companies.

* "Ideas first":
    * Companies **brainstorm** product or service ideas, then test them with
      customers to see how well they fit customer needs
    * This approach is **inherently flawed**, yet **extremely popular**.
        * > If you want to succeed, double your failure rate.
          >
          > - IBM founder Thomas Watson
    * **Customers cannot articulate the solutions that they want.**
        * > "Why are we even asking customers what solutions they want?"
        * It's OUR job as designers and engineers to solve problems!
* "Needs first":
    * Companies study their customers to learn **what their needs are**,
    * then find out **which of their customers' needs are unmet**.
    * Most companies which _try_ to follow a "needs first" approach execute the
      approach poorly.

Jobs-to-be-Done advocates a particular way to successfully implement the
"Needs first" approach for innovation.

## Jobs to be Done

The "Jobs to be Done" framework is all about building a way to
**talk about customer needs** so that we can efficiently find and meet them

> **"People don't want to buy a quarter-inch drill.
> They want a quarter-inch hole!"**
>
> - Levitt

The authors experience has suggested

* customers are loyal to **the jobs that they need done**, **not** to their
  (current) solutions to those jobs
* customers are willing to change solutions (**only**) if the new solution
  **solves the job 20% better**

### The Language of Jobs to be Done

A **job** is a task that a customer needs to perform.

An **outcome** is a measure that a customer (usually, implicitly) uses to
determine if the job was done well.

### Articulating Needs as "Jobs"

Customers have **dozens to hundreds of separate needs**. It is therefore
important to **carefully articulate each important need** and avoid clumping too
many together.

No single solution can address every one of a customer's needs.

Even for a single job and a single solution, some customers (or segments of
customers) may consider the solution to solve the job well, and some not.

* It's therefore important to segment customers **by their needs** rather than
  by demographics, economics, etc.

#### Don't confuse jobs and solutions.

Jobs should be stable over time. "Enjoy listening to music" is a job;
solutions (vinyl records, CDs, MP3 players, streaming) change over time.

Jobs are generally indifferent to the way that they're solved. A single job
could be solved either on paper or on a computer; in person or virtually; etc.

#### Don't forget about "emotional" and "social" outcomes

How people want to feel (or avoid feeling!) when doing tasks is also important.

#### Avoid conflating outcomes and jobs

#### Avoid conflating situations and jobs

A _situation_ such as "being bored" isn't a job.

"Overcoming boredom" is closer, but is too general to be analyzed. Pick a more
specific job, such as "enjoy a beverage during a commute".

#### A suggested format

> (verb) (object) + (context)

For example, "Listen to music while on the go."

The "context" should clarify what kind of customer has the job, and therefore
what outcomes and sub-needs may be important. A commuter vs a student vs a WFH
employee may have very different priorities when trying to solve the above job.

### Figure out what your customer's outcome metrics are

Your customers may want to get the job done

* quicker
* cheaper
* with less waste
* more predictably
* ...

They probably care about multiple of these dimensions, but they probably care
about some more than others.

If you find out which are most important, you can make sure that you're
innovating in a way that will actually make your solution meet their needs
better.

_Remember that you need to be at least 20% better than the alternative to
convince a customer to switch to your solution!_

# Strategy

In business, one of the fundamental goals is to _make money_. Similarly, a
fundamental outcome customers have is _how cheap the solution was_.

A solution will win when it gets a job done _better_ (quicker, more reliably,
more efficiently, ...), but _better_ is often at odds with _cheaper_.

This suggests four main "quadrants" of business opportunity that should be
tackled differently:

|                                       |  _More expensive_ than<br />other solutions     | | _Cheaper_ than<br />other solutions    |
|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-|----------------------------------------|
| **_Worse_ than<br />other solutions** | Capture customers with _completely unmet needs_ | | Capture customers who are _overserved_ |
|                                       |                                                 | |                                        |
| **_Better_ than<br />other solutions**| Capture customers with _under-met needs_        | | ***The ideal!***                       |

An **overserved** customer has solutions to needs that they don't value (for
example, lots of shiny features that they don't actually care about)

* To capture these customers, target _cost reduction_: do the same job, but
  cheaper.

An **underserved** customer has a solution that meets some of their needs, but
not others.
* To capture these customers, target their _most important needs_ or build
  solutions that _improve their most important outcomes_.

## Value Proposition

To convince a customer to buy your solution, you need to convince them that your
solution meets their needs better (at least 20% better!) than the current
solution.

So, market based on the _outcome that is most important to the customer_. The
same solution, marketed based on different _outcomes_, could seem much better or
much worse than alternatives to a customer!

Sometimes, customers have unmet needs that could be met by a _product or service
you already have on sale!_ But if you don't market the product around meeting
that need (or improving the most important outcome), customers won't know they
can have that need met!

# Outcome Driven Innovation: Executing Jobs-to-be-Done

**Outcome Driven Innovation** (ODI) is the name of the process to follow that
executes on the theory presented by "Jobs to be Done".

ODI defines the **customer** as the person who **executes the job**.

They are **not** the person who **purchases the solution**. They are the person
who **sees the outcome of the job**, and so they **are the best person to ask
about what outcomes are important**.

The **purchase decision maker** is more interested in **financial outcomes**
(such as how much the solution costs), and generally less interested in
functional outcomes (how well the job was done).
