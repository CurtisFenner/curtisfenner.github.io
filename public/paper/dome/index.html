<h1>UV Hemisphere Net</h1>
<p>
	This is a "UV-hemisphere". A "UV-sphere" is an approximation of a sphere
	based on the "grid" of trapezoids formed between equally spaces lines of
	latitude (parallels) and longitude (meridians).
<p>
	This net is based on
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2STS0POwB7g">Duncan Birmingham's video on domes on the Pop-Up Channel</a>,
	but it uses a net with more accurate geometry than the easy-to-sketch diamond and circles construction in the video.
<p>
	Put together, it looks something like this: (This is my first attempt; the
	tabs that hold the 'arms' together were too short; I lengthened them in
	the attached net, so hopefully you will have more luck with it staying together!)

<p>
	Coming soon, the calculations that go into making the net. To assemble the
	above, print it at 1:1 scale, and attach the base gluetabs with their folds
	exactly 4cm from the card's central fold.
<p>
	It gets a little more round looking if you poke the top of it after
	opening. It might be possible to put a mechanism inside that pulls it down
	so that it automatically opens nicely, but I haven't experimented yet.
